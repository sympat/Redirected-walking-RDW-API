# Redirected-walking-RDW-API
This is redirected walking API for our lab.

Because locomotion in virtual reality affects a user’s experience, various researches have studied locomotion techniques to provide a realistic experience. Among the locomotion techniques, actual walking induces higher immersion and natural and effective exploration for users. ReDirected Walking (RDW) has been studied as a technique that can overcome the difference between virtual and real space to explore a virtual environment through real walking. In particular, much research has been done on finely manipulating the user’s scene in a range that the user is unaware of.
